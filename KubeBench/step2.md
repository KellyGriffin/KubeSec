To interact with Kubernetes weâ€™ll use the command line interface, kubectl. 

To check if kubectl is installed you can run the *kubectl version* command:

`kubectl version`{{execute}}

OK, kubectl is configured and we can see both the version of the client and as well as the server. The client version is the kubectl version; the server version is the Kubernetes version installed on the master. You can also see details about the build.
